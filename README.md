1. Data Overview and Preprocessing 

	•	Goal: To forecast future values based on historical data using time series models.
	•	Dataset: The data used in this notebook consists of historical time series values, loaded and prepared for modeling.

2. ARIMA Model 

The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is commonly used for time series analysis and forecasting. This model is suitable for data that shows patterns such as seasonality and trend.

	•	Parameter Selection: We use the pmdarima library’s auto_arima function to automatically select the optimal parameters (p, d, q) based on model performance metrics like AIC and BIC.
	•	Model Training: After identifying the best parameters, we fit the ARIMA model to the training data.
	•	Forecasting: The model provides forecasts for future time points.
	•	Plotting Results: We visualize the predictions and actual values to evaluate the model’s performance.

3. Prophet Model 

The Prophet model, developed by Facebook, is an additive model known for handling seasonal patterns and holiday effects, making it particularly useful for business and economic data.

	•	Data Preparation: Prophet requires specific column names (ds for dates and y for target values), so the dataset is formatted accordingly.
	•	Model Training: We train the Prophet model on the data and use it for future forecasting.
	•	Plotting Results: The model’s predictions are plotted to visually assess the performance and patterns in forecasted data.

4. Evaluation and Comparison 

	•	Metrics: Both models are evaluated using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), allowing for direct comparison.
	•	Conclusion: We analyze which model performs best for our dataset, considering both the accuracy metrics and the visual alignment of predictions to actual values.

Libraries Used

	•	pandas and numpy: For data manipulation and handling.
	•	pmdarima: For automatic ARIMA parameter selection.
	•	fbprophet (Prophet): For building and training the Prophet model.
	•	matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizing the data and model predictions.

Instructions

	1.	Load the notebook and ensure all required libraries are installed.
	2.	Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the time series analysis and forecasting.
	3.	Evaluate the outputs and modify the model parameters as needed for different datasets.

This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to time series forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet, with clear steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
